# Risk, Contigency, and Strategy Overview

* An **anti-pattern** is a commonly occuring pattern or solution in projects with *negative* consequences.

* When projects get stuck in the specification phrase waiting for the perfectionization of requirements it is called **analysis/paralysis**.

* **Silos** is when teams don't communicate leading to an incoherent product.

* How to choose between two data libraries for a mobile app - each dev writes their choice on a bit of paper, reveal their choices at the same time, and then discuss. This avoids **group think**.

* **Firedrill** anti-pattern - little value is provided by the product for a while but developers are forced to complete user stories for the sprint review.

* **Technology risk** - mobile application has a growing user base and the server side platform cannot keep up with demand.
